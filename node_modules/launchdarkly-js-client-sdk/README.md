# LaunchDarkly SDK for JavaScript - Main Package

This file contains the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` package, which is the standard interface for the LaunchDarkly SDK for browser JavaScript. It is described in the [main README](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/blob/master/README.md).

This package automatically imports `launchdarkly-js-sdk-common`, which provides much of the underlying implementation.
